## 🎯 **What Is Krib AI?**

### **Two Main Services:**
1. **Short-Term Rentals** (Vacation/Airbnb-style) - AI helps find and book your perfect vacation spot
2. **Long-Term Rentals** (Real Estate) - AI handles apartment hunting, applications, and lease signing

## 💡 **In Simple Terms**

We built the **digital brain** of a rental platform that can handle everything a property management company does - but automatically, faster, and smarter. It's like having a team of rental experts, real estate agents, and contract lawyers working 24/7, but it's all code running in the cloud.

The system is ready to handle **thousands of properties** and **hundreds of users** simultaneously, with room to scale to much larger numbers as the business grows.

**Bottom Line**: We've created the technological foundation for a rental platform that can compete with Airbnb, Apartments.com, and traditional real estate companies - all powered by AI and modern cloud technology.
