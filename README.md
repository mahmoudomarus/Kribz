# Krib - AI-Powered Rental Platform

(Intelligent agents for property rentals and bookings)

![Krib Screenshot](frontend/public/banner.png)

Krib is a comprehensive AI-powered rental platform that revolutionizes both short-term and long-term property rental experiences. Through intelligent agents, Krib automates the entire rental process from search to contract signing, making property rentals as simple as having a conversation with your AI assistant.

**For Short-Term Rentals (Airbnb-style)**: AI agents handle property search, booking coordination, payment processing, and guest services - essentially booking your perfect vacation rental for you automatically.

**For Long-Term Rentals (Real Estate)**: AI agents manage property viewings, rental applications, contract generation, DocuSign integration, and commission processing - streamlining the entire tenant acquisition process for real estate companies.

## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/diagram.png)

Krib consists of four main components:

### Backend API

FastAPI service deployed on **Heroku** that handles REST endpoints, agent orchestration, and integrations with property management systems, payment processors, and DocuSign.

### Frontend

Next.js/React application deployed on **Vercel** providing responsive interfaces for guests, hosts, real estate companies, and property managers.

### Agent System

Intelligent AI agents that automate:
- **Property Search & Booking** for short-term rentals
- **Viewing Scheduling & Applications** for long-term rentals  
- **Contract Generation & DocuSign Integration**
- **Commission Processing & Property Management**

### Database

**Supabase** (PostgreSQL) with authentication, user management, property listings, booking history, contract storage, and real-time synchronization.

## Use Cases

### Short-Term Rentals (Vacation/Airbnb Style)
1. **Automated Booking Agent** - _"Find and book a 2-bedroom apartment in Barcelona for next weekend under â‚¬150/night with good reviews and close to the beach"_
2. **Trip Planning Assistant** - _"Book accommodation, transportation, and activities for a 5-day business trip to London including airport transfers"_
3. **Guest Concierge** - _"Handle check-in procedures, provide local recommendations, and coordinate any issues during my stay"_

### Long-Term Rentals (Real Estate Companies)
1. **Viewing Coordinator** - _"Schedule property viewings for interested tenants based on their availability and preferences"_
2. **Application Processor** - _"Collect tenant applications, verify references, and generate comprehensive reports for landlords"_
3. **Contract Automation** - _"Generate tenancy agreements, send via DocuSign to both parties, and process commission payments once signed"_
4. **Property Management** - _"Remove rented properties from listings, update availability, and coordinate handover procedures"_
