# Krib AI - Multi-Agent Rental Platform - Development Tasks

## Platform Vision

Krib AI is an AI-powered rental platform that serves two main markets:

**Short-Term Rentals (Airbnb-style)**: AI agents that handle property search, booking coordination, payment processing, and guest services - essentially booking your perfect vacation rental automatically.

**Long-Term Rentals (Real Estate Companies)**: AI agents that manage property viewings, rental applications, contract generation with DocuSign integration, and commission processing - streamlining the entire tenant acquisition process.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI on Heroku with Redis
- **Frontend**: Next.js/React on Vercel  
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
